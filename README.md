## Project

### Autocomplete website/widget

#### Description
- A website that enables users to quickly find and select dogs from a list of suggestions, as they type.
- The list is dynamically generated from a list of dog breeds stored as a JSON file on the Heroku server.
- Once the dog is selected, a random picture of the specimen is displayed. Every FETCH click will render a new random picture of this breed's specimen.
- The subreeds, such as Yorkshire terrier are displyed in brackets, i.e. terrier (Yorkshire). To find Yorkshire terrier, select terrier.

#### The App structure

The server handles the search and stores the object with all the dog breeds available.

All other operations including the API call to DOG.CEO.API are handled from the client's side.
